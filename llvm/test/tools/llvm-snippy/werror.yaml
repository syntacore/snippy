# COM: FIXME: It looks like we must categorize our warnings as ones that can
# COM: evolve to error eventually and ones that cannot. Maybe warnings from the
# COM: second groups mustn't be warnings at all but something like remarks?
# CHECK: error: (no-model-exec) Skipping snippet execution on the model: model was set no 'None'.
