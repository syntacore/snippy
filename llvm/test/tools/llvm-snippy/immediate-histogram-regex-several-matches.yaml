# have 2 REGEXs that both match ADDI instruction. They are ordered differently. We check
# that ADDI ends up having configuration of the first match met.

# CHECK: warning: (inconsistent-options) Unused regex in immediate histogram:
# CHECK-SAME: all opcodes were already matched so no opcodes remained to be matched by "ADD{{I|\.\*}}"
