#  This test checks that llvm-snippy will not corrupt reserved registers
#  during postprocessMemoryOperands() of additional memory operands.
#
#  Additional memory operands are not marked as OPERAND_MEMORY by target
#  description, that's why target-independent part of snippy treats them
#  as regular register operands.
#
#  In this particular case stack pointer is main concern - if it gets
#  corrupted, trap access fault will be generated upon reload in epilogue
#  and last instruction(ebreak) will not be reached.
